# Algorithm Solutions Collection

## Overview

This repository contains my personal collection of algorithm solutions in various programming languages. The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey in computer science and algorithmic problem-solving.

Each folder in this repository represents a different algorithm or problem, containing solutions in different programming languages, along with explanations and notes.

## Contents

- `3Sum Problem`
  - `python/`: Solution in Python.
  - `hack/`: Solution in Hack (by Meta).
  - `ruby/`: Solution in Ruby.
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem and overview of each solution.

## Usage

You can browse through each folder to see the solutions in different languages. Each folder contains a `README.md` file with specific details about the problem and the approach used in the solutions.

## Contributing

While this is a personal learning project, suggestions and contributions are welcome. If you have an improved solution or a new problem to add, feel free to create a pull request.
